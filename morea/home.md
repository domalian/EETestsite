EE 213 is the second part of circuit analysis that dives deeper into Laplace transforms and their application to circuits, Fourier transforms and their applications to circuits, frequency selective circuits, introduction to and design of active filters, convolution, and state space analysis of circuits.

## Who should take this course

This course is intended for undergraduates in electrical or computer engineering who have a working knowledge of basic circuit analysis and who want to get a taste of important topics in the field.

## Pedagogy

EE 213 is structured as a sequential series of [modules](/modules), each taking approximately a week to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing skills you should have prior to starting the module.
